## Overview

This plug-in imports Jira Service Management incidents and saves them as IBM DevOps Velocity issues. Data between the Jira Service Management server and the IBM DevOps Velocity server is synchronized every five minutes.

## Compatibility

IBM Devops Velocity 5.0.0 or later.

## Versions

IBM DevOps Velocity plug-in images are located in DockerHub. To view available versions, see the [UrbanCode DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/urbancode/ucv-ext-jira-service-management/tags).

With the integration of Jira Service Management, incident data is now accessible directly within the VSM Dot setup. This feature allows users to:
* **Track the progression** of dots as they move through different stages of the incident management workflow.
* **Identify bottlenecks** where incidents may be delayed or stuck.
* **Monitor resolution time** by easily viewing how long it takes for incidents to be closed.
* **All Dot View** offers comprehensive details for each individual incident, enabling users to review incident-specific information quickly and efficiently.
