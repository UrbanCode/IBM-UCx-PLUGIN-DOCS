ServiceNow supports application delivery by integrating service management processes, social collaboration for IT departments, software-as-a-service delivery, and web functionality. The ServiceNow plug-in for IBM DevOps Velocity automates the importing of records for ServiceNow incident management (beta), change management, and problem management from a ServiceNow server.
