# Azure DevOps - Overview

The Azure DevOps (formerly *Microsoft Team Foundation Server or TFS*) plug-in provides for integration with an Azure DevOps server. This plug-in imports work items, commits, pull requests and deployment data from an Azure DevOps server and saves them as DevOps Velocity issues. Data between the Azure DevOps server and the DevOps Velocity server is synchronized every five minutes.

## Compatibility

Must be running DevOps Velocity version 1.2.1 and later to use the plug-in.

## Versions

There is no install process for this plug-in. The Azure DevOps plug-in is identified to DevOps Velocity as a value stream integration. DevOps Velocity plug-in images are located in DockerHub and the IBM DevOps Velocity code accesses the version that you select. To view available versions, see the [UrbanCode DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/urbancode/ucv-ext-azure/tags).
