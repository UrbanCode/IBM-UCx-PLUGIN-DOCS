# Jira - Usage

To use the Jira plug-in, the plug-in must be loaded and an instance created before you can configure the plug-in integration. You define configuration properties in the user interface or in a JSON file.

## Integration type

The Jira plug-in supports scheduled events integration which are listed in the following table.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SyncJiraDataEvent | Synchronize data from a Jira server. |

## Minimum permission to integrate with Jira

The Jira Account used to generate the access token must have access to the project which is being integrated with IBM DevOps Velocity.

## Integration

To install the plug-in, perform the following steps:

1. In IBM DevOps Velocity, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Available**.
2. In the **Action** column for the Jira plug-in, click **Install**.

There are two methods to integrate the plug-in:

1. Using the user interface.
2. Using a JSON file

The tables in the Configuration properties topic describe the properties used to define the integration.

## Integrating the plug-in by using user interface

To integrate the plug-in using the user interface, perform the following steps:

1. In IBM DevOps Velocity, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Installed**.
2. In the **Action** column for the Jira plug-in, click **Add Integration**.
3. On the Add Integration dialog, enter the values for the fields to configure the integration and define communication.
4. Click **Add**.

## Integrating the plug-in by using JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating a value stream. Within the JSON file is a section for integrations. It is in this section that plugin properties can be defined. Refer to the JSON sample code in the Configuration Properties section.

To integrate the plug-in using a JSON, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to **value stream page**, and then click the necessary **value stream**.
2. Click  **wrench icon**, and then Select **Edit value stream** to modify the JSON file in the code or tree view editors.
Alternatively, you can also click Download JSON option to download the JSON file, and then select the Import JSON option to upload the revised JSON file.
3. Edit the integration information in the JSON file to add the plug-in configuration properties. Refer to JSON sample code in the Configuration Properties section more details.
4. Click **Save**.

## Configuration properties

The following tables describe the properties used to configure the integration. Each table contains the field name when using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON file.

* The General Configuration Properties table describes configuration properties used by all plug-in integrations.
* The Jira Configuration Properties table describes the configuration properties that define the connection and communications with the Jira server. When using the JSON method to integrate the plug-in these properties are coded within the `properties` configuration property.
