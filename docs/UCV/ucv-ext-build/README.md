# DevOps Build

DevOps Build is a distributed, multi-platform, enterprise-scale build management tool for configuring and running software builds.

The DevOps Build plug-in for IBM DevOps Velocity imports build data from DevOps Build into IBM DevOps Velocity. Build activities can be mapped in the IBM DevOps Velocity pipeline and build results can be tracked from the pipeline.
