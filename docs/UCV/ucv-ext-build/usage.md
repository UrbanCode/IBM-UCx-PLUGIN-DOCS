# DevOps Build - Usage

To use the DevOps Build plug-in, you must load the plug-in, and then configure the plug-in for integration.
Refer configuration properties table for more details.

## Integration type

The DevOps Build plug-in supports scheduled events integration which are listed in the following table.

| Name | Description | Interval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SyncApplicationsEvent | Query the Build server for Build Projects | 5 minutes |
| SyncBuildsEvent | Query the Build server for Build Lives | 5 minutes |
| SyncProcessesEvent | Query the Build server for Build Processes | 5 minutes |

## Integration

There are two methods to integrate the plug-in:

* Using the user interface
* Using a JSON file

The tables in the Configuration properties section describe the properties used to define the integration.

To install the plug-in, perform the following steps:

1. In **IBM DevOps Velocity**, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Available**
2. In the **Action** column, for the DevOps Build plug-in, click **Install**.

### Integrating the plug-in by using user interface

To integrate the plug-in using the user interface, perform the following steps:
1. In **IBM DevOps Velocity**, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Installed**.
2. In the **Action** column for the DevOps Build plug-in, click **Add Integration**.
3. On the Add Integration dialog, enter values for the fields used to configure the integration and define communication.
4. Click **Add**.

### Integrating the plug-in by using JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating a value stream. Within the JSON file is a section for integrations. It is in this section that plugin properties can be defined. Refer to the sample JSON code.

To integrate the plug-in using a JSON, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to **value stream page**, and then click the necessary **value stream**.
2. Click **wrench** icon, and then Select **Edit value stream** to modify the JSON file in the code or tree view editors.
3. Alternatively, you can also click **Download JSON** option to download the JSON file, and then select the Import JSON option to upload the revised JSON file.
4. Edit the **integration information** in the JSON file to add the plug-in configuration properties. Refer to JSON sample code in the Configuration Properties section more details.
5. Click **Save**.

## Configuration Properties

The following tables describe the properties used to configure the integration. Each table contains the field name when using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON file.

* The General Configuration Properties table describes configuration properties used by all plug-in integrations.
* The DevOps Build Configuration Properties table describes the DevOps Build configuration properties that define the connection and communications with the DevOps Build server. When using the JSON method to integrate the plug-in these properties are coded within the properties configuration property.

Some properties might not be displayed in the user interface, to see all properties enable the **Show Hidden Properties** field.

### JSON code sample

The following sample code can be used as a template to define the integration within the JSON file for a value stream. Copy and paste the template into the JSON file Integration section and make the appropriate changes.

## Example using the access key 

```
integrations": [
    {
      "type": "ucv-ext-build",
      "name": "Plugin for build",
      "tenant_id": "tenant_id",
      "logginglevel": "info",
      "properties": {
        "_userAccessKey": "IBM_DevOps_velocity_user_accesskey",
