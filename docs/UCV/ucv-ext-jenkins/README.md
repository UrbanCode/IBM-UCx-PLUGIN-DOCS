# Jenkins

Jenkins plug-in in DevOps Velocity will pull jobs from Jenkins and provide as an Input to the release pipelines or as an automation task in deployment plan. This helps deployment teams to orchestrate the deployment of the input builds into controlled environments with defined checks and balances. This is a scheduled plug-in that runs every 5 minutes to check any new builds in Jenkins and pull them into DevOps Velocity.
