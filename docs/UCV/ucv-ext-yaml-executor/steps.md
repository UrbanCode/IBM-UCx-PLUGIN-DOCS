## Importing YAML configuration file into DevOps Velocity

Import the YAML configuration file into DevOps Velocity by using any one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Using GitHub plug-in

Integrate DevOps Velocity with a GitHub repository that contains the ucv.yml file to import the YAML configuration file into DevOps Velocity.

Perform the following steps to import the YAML configuration file using GitHub plug-in:

1. Log in to DevOps Velocity.
2. Click **Settings>Integrations**.
3. In the Installed tab, click **Add Integration** for the installed GitHub plug-in.

6. Click **Add** to save the details and enable the integration.
   
   The YAML configuration file from the GitHub repository is automatically synced to DevOps Velocity and displayed under Settings>External config pipeline.

### Method 2: Using user interface

You can import the YAML configuration file into DevOps Velocity using user interface if it is not hosted in a GitHub repository.

Perform the following steps to add YAML configuration file using user interface:

1. Log in to DevOps Velocity.
2. Click **Settings>External config pipeline**.
3. Click **Download sample yaml** to download the sample YAML file.
4. Edit the sample file with the actual values of your configuration.

## YAML configuration file properties

The YAML configuration file is used to define configuration settings for automating the initial setup process for integrating various CI/CD tools into DevOps Velocity.

### YAML File Structure

The following table describe the properties used to define the configuration in the YAML file.

|Property name |Type  |Description                          |Required|
|--------------|------|-------------------------------------|--------|
|version	   |String| The version number of YAML file.	|Yes     |	
|integrations  |Array | List of integration configurations. |Yes     |	

#### Integrations

The following table describe the properties that you must define under integrations:

|Property name|Type  |Description	                                   |Required|
|-------------|------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|
|type	     |String|Type or category of the CI/CD tool.	           |Yes     |
|attributes   |Object|Additional attributes specific to the integration.|Yes     |
|configs	  |Object|	Configuration object for the integration.	 |Yes     |

##### Configuration Object

The following table describe the properties that you must define under configs :

|Property name|Type  |Description	                               |Required|
|-------------|------|----------------------------------------------|--------|
|name	     |String|Name of the configuration.	                |Yes     |
|loggingLevel |String|Logging level for the integration.	        |Yes     |
|deltaTime	|String|Optional: Time difference for the integration.|Yes     |

For additional configuration properties depending on integration type, navigate to respective plug-in and look for general configuration properties section for more details.

### Sample YAML configuration file

Following is the sample YAML configuration file with existing integration.

```
version: "8.0.0"
integrations:
  - type: ucv-ext-launch
    name: Test
    attributes:
      auto-config: true
      application: [
         "Test1"
      ],
      appEnvOrder: ["QA", "DEV", "PROD"]
      integrationId: 12345678,
      team: Loop3
```

Replace the property values in the sample file with the actual values specific to your configuration.

#### Customizing YAML configuration file

Perform the following steps to customize the YAML configuration file for your required integrations:

1. Open the YAML configuration file in a text editor.
2. Update `version` property with the appropriate version number.
3. Under `integrations` property, add or remove any property as required.
4. For each integration, add `type`, `attributes`, and `configs` property. `name` is optional if we want to overwrite valuestream name.
5. In valuestream, To filter pipeline based on application add `applications` and `teams` to map value stream against the team.
6. Under `configs` property, you must add the required properties based on the integration type. if `integrationId` is specified then configs is optional.
7. To order the environment while syncing, use the `appEnvOrder` property.
8. Set the `auto-config` attribute to **true** for enabling automatic setup of pipeline applications processes and environments after creating a new integration.
9. Save the YAML configuration file.
