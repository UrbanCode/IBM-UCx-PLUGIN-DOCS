# YAML Executor - Overview

The YAML Executor plug-in is automatically installed and configured without manual configuration. You can apply the YAML file under **Settings>External Config Pipeline** to initiate the YAML Executor plug-in integration process.


## Compatability

This plug-in requires DevOps Velocity version 4.0.12 and later.

## Versions

DevOps Velocity plug-in images are located in DockerHub. To

## History

### Version 0.0.13

* **Bug fix**: Resolved an issue where userAccessKey was not reliably fetched during concurrent requests in the measure. This caused some requests to fail or not execute until retried. The YAML Executor plugin now runs all requests consistently as expected.

### Version 0.0.12

* **Bug fix**: The issue involving the triggering of the existing integrated Deploy Plug-in through the YAML Executor plugin has been resolved.

### Version 0.0.11

* **Feature enhancement**: Added a new parameter, appEnvOrder, within the attributes section of the configuration. This parameter enables users to explicitly specify the sequence in which environments are created, ensuring that the environment creation process adheres to the defined order.

### Version 0.0.7

* **Added extra parameter**: Added below new parameters to configure valuestream.
* **name**: Specify the name for the ValueStream.
* **application**: Filter resources to include only the specified application in the pipeline section.
* **integrationId**: Reuse an existing integration configuration. If integrationId specified then `configs` field is optional.
* **team**: Associate the ValueStream with a specific team.
* **appEnvOrder**: To order the environment in the valuestream pipeline while syncing

### Version 0.0.8

* **Improvisation** : Plug-in synchronization has been optimized to align with scheduled events, with particular emphasis on the end time. Additionally, failure scenarios related to pipeline creation and value stream processing have been resolved.

### Version 0.0.6

* Started using timeSpan for Initial Sync date.

### Version 0.0.5

* Initial release
