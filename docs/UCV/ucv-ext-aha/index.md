# Aha!

Aha! plug-in is used to integrate Aha! application with DevOps Velocity(Velocity). The plug-in extracts the Product Value of an Aha! feature to store it as business value in the Jira issues linked with the Aha! feature and displays it in value streams. The business value associated with the value stream will help you to prioritize your work based on the features that are most valuable for customers.
**Note**: Currently you can only see the business value only for the Aha! issues that are linked to a Jira issue in the value stream. New search capability is added to filter the value stream dot consisting of business value using DQL search. You can use issue.businessValue item in the DQL search to filter the value stream dots associated with business value. See, DevOps query language (DQL).
