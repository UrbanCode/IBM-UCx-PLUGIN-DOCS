# Jenkins For DevOps Velocity

With this Jenkins plugin, you can run Jenkins jobs as a part of a deployment plan in DevOps Velocity. You can run jobs that trigger the creation of a version in an DevOps Velocity pipeline and persist properties on that version that can be used as input properties in other Jenkins builds. This plugin passes the required data from Git to the DevOps Velocity pipeline.
