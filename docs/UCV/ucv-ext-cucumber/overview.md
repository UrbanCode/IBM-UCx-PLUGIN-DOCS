# Cucumber - Overview

The Cucumber plug-in automates running Cucumber test scenarios. Test scenarios are based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) written to test product features. Cucumber test scenarios are written using the Gherkin syntax. Each scenario contains a set of steps that are verified processed by the Cucumber tool. A report of success or failure is generated for each scenario. Scenarios are stored as .feature text files. Step Definitions, referred to as glue contain a Java method linking to one or more scenario steps.
