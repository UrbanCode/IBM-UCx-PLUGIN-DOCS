PMD
===

PMD is an open source source code analyzer for Java source code. It scans source code looking for potential programming issues and produces a report of found problems.Some of the types of issues that are located are: unused variables, empty catch blocks, and unnecessary loops and IF statements.

The PMD plug-in uploads the results of the PMD analyzer generated during the build process and places them on the **Analytics** tab of the BuildLife.
