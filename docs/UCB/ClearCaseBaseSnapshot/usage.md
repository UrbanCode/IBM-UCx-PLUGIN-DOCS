ClearCase Base Snapshot - Usage
===============================

# Usage


### Usage




The IBM UrbanCode Build ClearCase Base Snapshot plug-in provides integration properties,that define the connection between the UrbanCode Build server and Rational ClearCase server. For details, see [Repositories](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8NMD_6.1.2/com.ibm.ucbuild.doc/topics/settings_project_repo_cpt.html). The integration automates populating a ClearCase workspace, creating a label, and publishing source changes to the Changes tab of the build life.


The repository is configured based on a workflow.
