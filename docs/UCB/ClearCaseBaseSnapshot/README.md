ClearCase Base Snapshot
=======================

IBM Rational ClearCase provides tools for supporting software configuration management (SCM) of source code and other software development assets.

The ClearCase Base Snapshot plug-in integrates IBM UrbanCode Build with IBM Rational ClearCase allowing source to be pulled from the SCM for builds. It also allows builds to be started from code commits to ClearCase.
