ClearCase UCM
=============

IBM Rational ClearCase provides tools for supporting software configuration management (SCM) of source code and other software development assets.

The ClearCase UCM plug-in integrates IBM UrbanCode Build with Rational ClearCase allowing source to be pulled from the ClearCase repository for builds. It also allows builds to be started from code commits to Rational ClearCase.
