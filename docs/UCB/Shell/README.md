Shell for IBM UrbanCode Build
=============================

A shell provides an interface for users of an operating system that provides access to the services of a kernel. Operating system shells generally fall into one of two categories: command-line and graphical. Command-line shells provide a command-line interface (CLI) to the operating system, while graphical shells provide a graphical user interface (GUI). In either category, the primary purpose of the shell is to invoke or launch another program; however, shells frequently have additional capabilities such as viewing the contents of directories.

The Shell plug-in includes steps to run custom shell scripts during a build.


Available Steps
