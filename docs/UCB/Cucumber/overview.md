Cucumber - Overview
===================

# Overview


### Overview




The Cucumber plug-in automates running Cucumber test scenarios. Test scenarios are based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) written to test product features.

Cucumber test scenarios are written using the Gherkin syntax. Each scenario contains a set of steps that are verified processed by the Cucumber tool. A report of success or failure is generated for each scenario. Scenarios are stored as `.feature` text files. Step Definitions, referred to as *glue* contain a Java method linking to one or more scenario steps.

The Cucumber plug-in contains two step that use the Cucumber command line interface to compile step definitions and run test scenarios.

This plug-in included the following steps:

* [Compile step definition](Steps/#compile_step_definition)
* [Run Testing](Steps/#run_testing)
