# IBM DevOps PHP CLI Tool

The IBM Urban Code PHP CLI tool provides the following capabilities:

* Create deployable artifact snapshots
* Share UCD configurations across systems and organisations
* Integrate UCD into a Jenkins pipeline
* Export/import UCD application settings/environment variables
* Backup and restore the entire UCD configuration

It leverages the existing UCD CLI support to provide these useful extensions.

This integration is developed and supported by the DevOps Deploy Community. Click the “Visit Project” button at the top of the page to download the CLI.
