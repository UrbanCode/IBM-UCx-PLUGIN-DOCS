# ServiceNow

**Note:** *Beginning with Version 21 of the plug-in, the following steps no longer require sys\_ids, but take the record number (ex. CHG0040001) instead:*

- Check Records
- Delete Records
- Update Records

ServiceNow integrates ITIL v3 processes, social collaboration for IT departments, software-as-a-service delivery, and modern Web functionality to deliver a flexible, easy-to-use and self-managing application.

The ServiceNow plug-in allows DevOps Deploy to easily perform CRUD operations on records with convenient steps such as check and query records.It is tested for compatibility with ServiceNow versions Eureka through Madrid.
