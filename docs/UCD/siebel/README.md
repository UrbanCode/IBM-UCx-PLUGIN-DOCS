# Siebel

Siebel is a customer relationship management (CRM) system that is produced by Oracle.

The Siebel plug-in is a community supported plug-in. Community plug-ins are open source projects that are developed and supported by the IBM DevOps development community. 

The Siebel plug-in for IBM DevOps Deploy uses the Siebel Java Data Bean (JDB) API and shell processes to connect to a specific Siebel infrastructure and remotely deploy and configure Siebel components.

For details on how the plug-in is constructed, how it works internally, or how to extend it yourself, see the design document that is contained in the project.

The GitHub release of the Siebel plug-in includes steps to complete the following tasks:

* Automate the Siebel deployment process.
* Configure business objects. For example: configure applications, groups, and servers.
* Configure business services. For example: import workflows, Siebel Messages, and business services XML files.
* Run shell scripts. For example: import repository files, start and stop servers, and generate browsers.
