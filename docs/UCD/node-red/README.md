# Node-RED

Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range nodes in the palette. Flows can be then deployed to the runtime in a single-click. JavaScript functions can be created within the editor using the rich capabilities of the embedded Eclipse Orion.
