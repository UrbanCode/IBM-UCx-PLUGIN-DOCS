# JBoss-ON

JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is network management software for deploying, managing, and monitoring JBoss middleware as well as Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTP Server, and other applications and services. The JBoss ON plug-in interacts with the rhq-cli command-line tool to provide access to JBoss ON management tasks. The rhq-cli tool is typically installed in your serverâ€™s management GUI.

For details on how the plug-in is constructed, how it works internally, or how to extend it yourself, see the README.md file that is contained in the project.

This is a community plug-in
