# Puppet

Puppet is a declarative, model-based approach to IT automation, helping you manage infrastructure throughout its lifecycle, from provisioning and configuration to orchestration and reporting. Using Puppet, you can easily automate repetitive tasks, quickly deploy critical applications, and proactively manage change, scaling from 10s of servers to 1000s, on-premise or in the cloud.

This plug-in enables you to apply puppet manifests, or call a puppet agent.

This plug-in is developed and supported by the DevOps Deploy Community on the IBM DevOps Services platform. Click the “Visit Project” button at the top of the page to navigate to the project for further information.
