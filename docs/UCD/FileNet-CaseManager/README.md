# FileNet - IBM Case Manager

IBM Case Manager simplifies the job of designing and building a case management system and provides a graphical user interface for case workers to easily manage cases. IBM Case Manager is deployed in an application server, and uses FileNet P8 to access and store content and solution assets.

The IBM Case Manager plug-in for DevOps deploy utilizes the configmgr\_cl command-line interface to automate the tasks normally completed via the configmgr UI.All of the steps were tested with IBM Case Manager version 5.3.1. In order for all commands to function properly, version 5.2.1 or later is required.
