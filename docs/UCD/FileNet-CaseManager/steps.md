| Production Profile | String | Specifies the production profile to use (ex. prod1). This profile must contain a defined Deploy Solution task, and the values to deploy must be set in the deploysolution.xml file. | Yes |

## Export Solution

Exports a case management solution from the development environment.



| Name | Type | Description                                                                                                          | Required |

| Profile | String | Specifies the profile to use. Can be specified as a name, full path to profile, or full path to input file. (ex. develop1). | Yes |
| Manifest Names | String | Specifies the name of the security manifest. To enter multiple, specify each manifest name on a new line. | Yes |
| Manifest Package | String | Specifies the exported security package ZIP file. You can specify the full path and file name for the exported security package ZIP file. Defaults to SolutionName\_securityManifest.zip. | Yes |
| Solution Name | String | Specifies the name of the solution that is associated with the security configuration. | Yes |

## Import Security Manifest

The importSolutionSecurityManifest command imports a security configuration package into another environment.


| Name | Type | Description                                                                                                          | Required |
