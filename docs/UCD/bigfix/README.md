# IBM BigFix

IBM BigFix helps reduce the time, cost and risk of managing virtually any mix of endpoints leveraging out-of-the-box automation scripts. It streamlines asset discovery, software distribution, and power management. It also provides the critical capability to manage and secure servers–whether they’re physical, virtual or remotely located.

Use the IBM BigFix plug-in to start BigFix actions from IBM DevOps Deploy processes.
