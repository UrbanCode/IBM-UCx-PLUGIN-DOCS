# z/OS Shell

> **Deprecation Notice**: The z/OS Shell plugin is deprecated. It is recommended to use the [Shell plugin](../Shell/README.md) instead.

The z/OS Shell plug-in is for the z/OS only operating system. It performs the same functions as the [Shell plug-in](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/Shell/) for DevOps Deploy. The plug-in reduces the CPU consumption in the z/OS environment by using Java code instead of Groovy code.
