# File System

The File System source config plug-in enables one to manually import artifacts from the file system into a folder. The artifacts are not stored into version folder, using this plug-in you must manually create versions. To import artifacts into version folders, use the [File System (Versioned)](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/FileSystemVersionedSourceConfig/) plug-in.

# Compatibility

This plug-in is supported to run on all operating systems supported by the IBM DevOps Deploy agent, except for z/OS.
