## Command

Use this step to apply the **command module** in Ansible.

| Name        | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    | Required |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| taskcommand | textBox     | cmd <br/> The command to run.                                                                                                                                                                  | Yes      |
| creates     | textBox     | A filename or (since ansible 2.0) glob pattern. If a matching file already exists, this step will not be run. <br/> This is checked before removes is checked.                                 | No       |
| environment | textAreaBox | It allows  to set environment variables at task level.                                                                                                                                         | No       |
| chdir       | textBox     | Change into this directory before running the command.                                                                                                                                         | No       |
| become      | textBox     | The become keyword uses existing privilege escalation tools like sudo, su, pfexec, doas, pbrun, dzdo, ksu, runas, machinectl and others. set to true OR yes to activate privilege escalation.  | No       |

## Copy

Use this step to apply the **copy module** in Ansible.

| Name       | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Required |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| src        | textBox     | Local path to a file to copy to the remote server.   <br/> This can be absolute or relative. <br/> If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with /, only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with /, the directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar to the rsync command line tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes      |
| dest       | textBox     | Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to.   <br/> If src is a directory, this must be a directory too.   <br/> If dest is a non-existent path and if either dest ends with / or src is a directory, dest is created.   <br/> If dest is a relative path, the starting directory is determined by the remote host.   <br/> If src and dest are files, the parent directory of dest is not created and the task fails if it does not already exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Yes      |
| owner      | textBox     | Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would be fed to chown.   <br/> When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.   <br/> Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | No       |

| mode       | textBox     | The permissions of the destination file or directory.   <br/> For those used to /usr/bin/chmod remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible’s YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like 0644 or 01777) or quote it (like '644' or '1777') so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number. Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.   <br/> As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, u+rwx or u=rw,g=r,o=r).   <br/> As of Ansible 2.3, the mode may also be the special string preserve.   <br/> preserve means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.   <br/> When doing a recursive copy, see also directory_mode.   <br/> If mode is not specified and the destination file does not exist, the default umask on the system will be used when setting the mode for the newly created file.   <br/> If mode is not specified and the destination file does exist, the mode of the existing file will be used.   <br/> Specifying mode is the best way to ensure files are created with the correct permissions. | No       |
| with_items | textAreaBox | with_items is a collection variable that can be used to store input values for verification against actual data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | No       |

In the case of a directory, if diff is declared, you will see the files and folders deleted listed under path_contents. Note that absent will not cause ansible.builtin.file to fail if the path does not exist as the state did not change.   <br/> If directory, all intermediate subdirectories will be created if they do not exist. Since Ansible 1.7 they will be created with the supplied permissions.   <br/> If file, with no other options, returns the current state of path.   <br/> If file, even with other options (such as mode), the file will be modified if it exists but will NOT be created if it does not exist.

| mode       | textBox     | The permissions of the destination file or directory.   <br/> For those used to /usr/bin/chmod remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible’s YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like 0644 or 01777) or quote it (like '644' or '1777') so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number. Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.   <br/> As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, u+rwx or u=rw,g=r,o=r).   <br/> As of Ansible 2.3, the mode may also be the special string preserve.   <br/> preserve means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.   <br/> When doing a recursive copy, see also directory_mode.   <br/> If mode is not specified and the destination file does not exist, the default umask on the system will be used when setting the mode for the newly created file.   <br/> If mode is not specified and the destination file does exist, the mode of the existing file will be used.   <br/> Specifying mode is the best way to ensure files are created with the correct permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                               | No       |

The choices vary based on Python version and OpenSSL version.   <br/> On systems running in FIPS compliant mode, the md5 algorithm may be unavailable.   <br/> Additionally, if a checksum is passed to this parameter, and the file exist under the dest location, the destination_checksum would be calculated, and if checksum equals destination_checksum, the file download would be skipped (unless force=true). If the checksum does not equal destination_checksum, the destination file is deleted.   <br/> If the checksum URL requires username and password, url_username and url_password are used to download the checksum file.   <br/> Default: ""                                 | No       |
| owner    | textBox | Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would be fed to chown.   <br/> When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.   <br/> Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | No       |

| mode     | textBox | The permissions of the destination file or directory.   <br/> For those used to /usr/bin/chmod remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible’s YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like 0644 or 01777) or quote it (like '644' or '1777') so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number. Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.   <br/> As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, u+rwx or u=rw,g=r,o=r).   <br/> As of Ansible 2.3, the mode may also be the special string preserve.   <br/> preserve means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.   <br/> When doing a recursive copy, see also directory_mode.   <br/> If mode is not specified and the destination file does not exist, the default umask on the system will be used when setting the mode for the newly created file.   <br/> If mode is not specified and the destination file does exist, the mode of the existing file will be used.   <br/> Specifying mode is the best way to ensure files are created with the correct permissions. | No       |

|-------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| shell | textBox | The shell module takes a free form command to run, as a string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Yes      |
| async | textBox | The async keyword triggers Ansible to run the task in the background which can be checked (or) followed up later, and its value will be the maximum time that Ansible will wait for that particular Job (or) task to complete before it eventually times out or complete.   <br/> So async keyword can tell Ansible how long the task should be allowed to run before Ansible gives it up and time out.   <br/> But How would ansible track the status of this job invoked in the background?  How frequent it would check if the task is completed or not.   <br/> That's where the poll keyword is coming into the picture.                                                                                                               | No       |
| poll  | textBox | The Poll keyword is auto-enabled whenever you use async and it has a default value as 10 seconds   <br/> Which means If you are not defining the poll keyword with customized time period. By default Ansible would track the status of the async task every 10 seconds.   <br/> If you think 10 seconds polling is too frequent and you want Ansible to test the status of the job every 60 seconds It is possible.   <br/> The poll keyword accepts a numeric value to know how many seconds it should wait before polling or following up with the long-running asynchronous task.   <br/> In other words, The value of the poll indicates how often to poll and check if the tasks are completed. The default poll value is 10 seconds. | No       |
| chdir | textBox | Change into this directory before running the command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | No       |

## Apt Key

Use this step to apply the **apt_key module** in Ansible.

> **Note:**
> ---------
>* The **apt-key command** used by this **module** has been **deprecated**. See the Debian wiki(https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty) for details.   <br/>
   This module is kept for backwards compatibility for systems that still use apt-key as the main way to manage apt repository keys.  <br/>
   Reference Ansible Official Documentation: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_key_module.html
>* In the **next release of the plugin**, this **step will be removed**.
