# IBM UrbanCode Deploy Agent Package for Dynamic Cloud Environments


To request a dynamic environment from a cloud system, you import information about resources on a cloud system. Then, you create an application blueprint that maps components to those resources.

The Install IBMÂ® UrbanCode Deploy Agent package automatically installs agents on cloud resources. When you provision an environment from the cloud system, this script package installs an agent on each node in the cloud resource request. Then, these agents contact the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and the server adds them to the environment.
