## Errors and solutions are included below

### PowerShell script execution failed. Error Message: Windows PowerShell is in NonInteractive mode. Read and Prompt functionality is not available

When scripts are run in non-interactive mode, `Stop-Process` requires the `-Force` option to make it non-interactive even if -Confirm:$false is set. Change the line of your script to: `Stop-Process -Name $process -Force`

#### Questions and answers are included below

**Why does the plug-in step succeed when the PowerShell script exits with a -128 error status?**
The plug-in is configured by default to accept a -128 status as success. By default, PowerShell exits with a 0 error status even if the script fails, so using 0 results in false positives. If the -128 status overlaps with a custom error status that is used in your script, change the error status in the hidden properties.

**How can I pass the -file parameter?**

Use one of the following options:

* Insert `PowerShell -non-interactive *-Additional\_Parameters\_Here*`
* Use the Shell plug-in to interact with the command line.

**How can I run the script in a multi-threaded apartment model?**

Perform the following:

* Navigate to the hidden properties.
* Add -MTA to one of the argument properties.

**Why is script output not displayed in the IBM DevOps Deploy log?**
The IBM DevOps Deploy log stores all PowerShell output. You may need to change the PowerShell output preferences. To learn more, refer to the Microsoft documentation here: <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847796.aspx>.
