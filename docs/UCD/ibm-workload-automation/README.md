# IBM Workload Automation

The IBM Workload Automation plug-in is a facility provided to help you moving workload automation definitions from one environment to another, in a distributed or z/OS environment. You can download a job stream definition from the Dynamic Workload Console, then IBM DevOps Deploy applies the appropriate environment parameters for the importing process that is performed by the plug-inâ€™s steps.

The IBM Workload Automation plug-in is a community plug-in. Community plug-ins are open source projects that are developed and supported by the IBM DevOps Development Community. Click Visit Project at the top of the page to go to the project for further information.
