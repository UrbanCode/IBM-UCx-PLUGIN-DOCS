# IBM Integration Bus (formerly WebSphere Message Broker) - CMP

IBM Integration Bus, from the WebSphere product family, enables business information to flow between disparate applications across multiple hardware and software platforms. The plug-in includes steps that can be used when designing a component process to deploy broker archives and to start, stop or delete message flows by using the IBM Integration API. For information on usage, including a sample of how to install IBM Integration Bus using IBM DevOps Deploy, see [How to automate IBM Integration Bus installation and deployments using IBM DevOps Deploy and Chef](https://www.urbancode.com/resource/how-to-automate-ibm-integration-bus-installation-and-deployments-using-ibm-urbancode-deploy-and-chef/).

This plug-in supports versions 9 & 10 of IBM Integration Bus (IIB). We no longer support WebSphere Message Broker (Versions 7 & 8). If you are looking for support for WebSphere Message Broker, please download a version of this plug-in that is less than version 40.

The IBM Integration Bus plug-in has been replaced by the [App Connect Enterprise" plug-in](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/#app-connect-enterprise). The IBM Integration Bus plug-in is incompatible with the newer versions of DevOps Deploy. It is recommended that you use the ACE plug-in.
