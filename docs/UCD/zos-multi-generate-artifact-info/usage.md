# z/OS Multi Generate Artifact Information - Usage

## Generate Multiple Artifact Information

Use the Generate Multiple Artifact Information plug-in to generate one or more multiple properties from z/OS artifacts. The plug-in extracts data based on filters.

### Example

This examples demonstrates using the plug-in to extract data based on filters to generate multiple templates in JSON format. The example is based on the version and containers shown below.

![](media/zos_example_containers.jpg?resize=640%2C189)

The sample JSON contains two templates assigned to properties Prop-DBRM and Prop-CICS.

```
{
    "Prop-DBRM" : " BIND (${member}) LIBRARY(${dataset}) \n" ,
    "Prop-CICS" : " CEMT SET PROGRAM(${member}) NEWC \n"
}

```

* Prop-DBRM contains each members bind statements for DB2 Binding process
* Prop-CICS contains RDO commands to set the latest copy of program in CICS

There is a CICS program under the COBOL container with name the CARP001 as shown below.

To filter COBOL and DBRM containers, the JSON template in Container filter JSON can be defined as:

```
{
    "Prop-CICS" : "/.*COBOL/",
    "Prop-DBRM" : "/.*DBRM/"
}
```

To filter member/resource name under the above container, the JSON template in Resource filter JSON can be defined as:

```
{
    "Prop-CICS": "CARP001"
}
```


After the plug-in step completes, the following output is received. Please note that in addition to Prop-CICS and Prop-DBRM, we generate an additional count (Prop-CICS-count and Prop-DBRM-count) that can be used with a “switch” step in the component process to decide whether to do a bind or not.

Similarly, you can use <b>deploy types</b> to create a template with only selected elements.

### Understanding custom properties filter in the plugin step through a scenario
#### Scenario
Let's assume a version with artifacts and custom properties

```xml
    <container name="BUILD.JCL" type="PDS">
        <resource name="AGNTTASK" type="PDSMember">
            <property name="OWNER" value="PROD"/>
            <property name="TYPE" value="JCL"/>
        </resource>
        <resource name="BINDJCL" type="PDSMember">
            <property name="OWNER" value="PROD"/>
            <property name="TYPE" value="DB2"/>
        </resource>
        <resource name="JCLA" type="PDSMember"  deployType="TEXT">
            <property name="OWNER" value="DEV"/>
            <property name="TYPE" value="JCL"/>
        </resource>
    </container>

```
Let's attempt to filter a resource that has custom properties OWNER and TYPE set to PROD and JCL. From the above version manifest, it is evident that only resource AGNTTASK matches the filter criteria.

In order to apply the filter criteria, pass the applicable properties as a json value. In this case, json looks like below
```json5
{
  "prod-jcl":"OWNER=PROD\nTYPE=JCL"
}
```

Note that the multiple properties should be separated by characters "\n", which signifies newline.

## Generate Multiple Artifact Information YAML

Generate multiple text information for selected version artifacts using YAML filters. The information is sent to the output
properties for use by later steps.

We introduced the new YAML step to address the following
* Keep all the property configurations at one place
* Option to add comments

Below is a sample configuration for two properties, 'cics-commands' with all the possible filters and 'all-datasets' with only mandatory input 'template'
* If a filter is not required, the respective line can be removed.
* Multiple properties can be generated by setting different configurations for each property
* Comments can be added followed by '#' as shown below.

```yaml
cics-commands:
  sourceContainer: '/.*DEV\.BUILD.*/'
  targetContainer: '/.*COBOL.*/'
  resource: /PAY.*/
  deployType: "/CICS.*/"
  customProperties:
    developer: "/M*"
    team: UCD
  template: "CEMT S PROG($member)\n"
  deployAction: created
all-datasets: # property name which contains the generated information
  template: "${dataset}\n" # 'template' is the only mandatory field for a property
```

`\n` in template adds new line in the generated text.
