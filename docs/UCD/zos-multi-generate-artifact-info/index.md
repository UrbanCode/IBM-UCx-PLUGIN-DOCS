# z/OS Multi Generate Artifact Information



The z/OS Multi Generate Artifact Information plug-in scans version artifacts and generates text based on a template. 
The output text can be used as an input property to subsequent steps. Use this plug-in to process data sets or members in a component version. You can also use the [Generate Multiple Artifact Information](steps.md#generate-multiple-artifact-information) step to select a set of artifacts to process by applying filters on data set names, member names, deployment types, and custom properties on each output property.
