## Overview

HCL AppScan on Cloud (ASoC) is an application security offering that allows you to scan on prem, web, and mobile applications for security vulnerabilities. The plugin allows you to run all supported types of scans and manage ASoC presences. Presences allow you to run scans on apps not connected to the internet or require a proxy server to make a connection.
