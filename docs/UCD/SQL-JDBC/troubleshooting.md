## Deploying Stored Procedures from UCD

The SQL-JDBC plugin does not support deploying stored procedures. We recommend using vendor provided tools such as IBM DB2 CLP, Oracle SQL\* Plus or SQL Cmd when applying updates directly from UCD.

* [Microsoft SQL Server SQL CMD](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/SQLCmd/)
* [Oracle SQL\*Plus](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/SQLPlus/)

For more advanced database deployments, consider using an intermediary tool such as Datical, DBMaestro and Liquibase.
