# Chef

This plug-in provides steps that enable you to integrate existing automation for Chef into your IBM DevOps Deploy Processes. The plug-in ships with an embedded version of Chef Solo (11.16.4-1), which can be installed and used to execute a node or you can specify a different installation of Chef to use, but the plug-in step must execute on a system where Chef is accessible locally.

**Platform Support:**

* This plug-in is supported to run on all operating systems that are supported by both the IBM DevOps Deploy agent (except for z/OS) and Chef
* This plug-in is supported to run against Chef v11.6.0-1 or higher
