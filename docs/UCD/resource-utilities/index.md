# Resource Utilities

The Resource Utilities plug-in supplements the existing IBM DevOps Deploy resources plugin with additional steps to help manage large resource trees and the properties on resources in large trees.

This is an open source plug-in and is developed and supported by the IBM DevOps Deploy Community on GitHub. At this time, not all the required jars are available for public use and therefore, are missing from the GitHub repository. To retrieve a working plugin, please use the ‘download’ link at the top of this page.
