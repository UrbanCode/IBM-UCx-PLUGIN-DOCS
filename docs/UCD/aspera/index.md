## Overview

The Aspera plug-in uses the Aspera ascp (Aspera secure copy) client to upload and download files to and from an Aspera server. The Aspera ascp client uses the FASP transfer protocol, which can outperform TCP-based file transfer protocols such as FTP and HTTP. For more information about FASP transfer technology, see the [Aspera website](https://www.ibm.com/products/aspera).
