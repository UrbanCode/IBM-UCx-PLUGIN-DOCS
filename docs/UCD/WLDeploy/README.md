# Oracle WebLogic WLDeploy

The **wldeploy** Ant task is used to complete **weblogic.Deployer** functions by using attributes that are specified in an Ant XML file. You can use the **wldeploy** Ant task with other WebLogic Server Ant tasks to create a single Ant build script.

With the Oracle WeblLogic WLDeploy plug-in, you can run a **wldeploy** Ant task as part of a deployment process. This plug-in also provides steps for other deployment actions such as: undeploy, deploy, and redeploy. It also can be used to start and stop WebLogic servers and clusters.

Version 14 and later require DevOps Deploy version 6.1.1.2 or later, and versions before 14 require DevOps Deploy 6.0.1 or later.
