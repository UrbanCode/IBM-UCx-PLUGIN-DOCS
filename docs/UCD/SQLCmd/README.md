# Microsoft SQL Server SQLCmd

With the sqlcmd utility, you can enter Transact-SQL statements, system procedures, and script files at the command prompt. You can enter these statements in Query Editor in SQLCMD mode, in a Windows script file, or in an operating system (Cmd.exe) job step of an SQL Server Agent job. This utility uses OLE DB to execute Transact-SQL batches.

SQLCMD is a command line application that comes with Microsoft SQL Server, and exposes the management features of SQL Server.

This plugin currently supports up to MSSQL 2012.
