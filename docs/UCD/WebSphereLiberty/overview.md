# IBM WebSphere Liberty

## Overview

The IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile is a lightweight configuration of IBM WebSphere Application Server. It provides rapid deployment of applications for use in the development process.

This plug-in includes steps that are related to working with servers in the profile, such as the following steps:

* [Create Server](steps#create_server)
* [Delete Server](steps#delete_server)
* [Start Server](steps#start_server)
* [Stop Server](steps#stop_server)

The plug-in also includes steps that install, update, and uninstall applications:

* [Install or Update Application with Drop-ins](steps#install_or_update_application_via_dropins)
* [Install or Update Application with Server XML](steps#install_or_update_application_via_server_xml)
* [Start Application](steps#start_application)
* [Stop Application](steps#stop_application)
* [Uninstall Application from Drop-ins](steps#uninstall_application_from_dropins)
* [Uninstall Application with Server XML](steps#uninstall_application_via_server_xml)
* [Wait for Application to be STARTED](steps#wait_for_application_to_be_started)

The following plug-in steps are related to working with Liberty collectives:

* [Create Collective](steps#create_collective)
* [Join Collective](steps#join_collective)
* [Register Host](steps#register_host)
* [Unregister Host](steps#unregister_host)
* [Update Host](steps#update_host)
* [Upload File To Collective Host](steps#upload_file_to_collective_host)

The following plug-in steps are related to working with the Liberty server configuration:

* [Generate Component-Resource Properties](steps#generate_component-resource_properties)
* [Replace Variable Values with Component-Resource Properties](steps#replace_variable_values_with_component-resource_properties)

### Compatibility

This plug-in requires version 6.0 or later of IBM DevOps Deploy.

This plug-in was tested with WebSphere Liberty profile versions 8.5.5.916.0.0.2.

### Installation

No special steps are required for installation. See [Installing plug-ins in IBM DevOps products](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/wasdevops/blogs/laurel-dickson-bull1/2022/06/13/install-plugins "Installing plug-ins in IBM DevOps products").

To use the [Wait for Application to be STARTED](steps#wait_for_application_to_be_started) step, you must complete the following steps to configure the REST connector for the WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile:

* In the `server.xml` file on the server, enable the REST connector, SSL certificates, and an administrator role for a user or group. You must use an administrator account to run the [Wait for Application to be STARTED](steps#wait_for_application_to_be_started) step. For more information, see the documentation for your version of the WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile. For example, for version 8.5, see the following topic: [Configuring secure JMX connection to the Liberty profile](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.doc/ae/twlp_admin_restconnector.html?cp=SSAW57_8.5.5%2F1-3-11-0-3-3-9-1&lang=en)
* Update the server to listen on all endpoints. For example, the default `server.xml` file contains a line that is similar to the following example: `<httpEndpoint host="localhost" httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443" id="defaultHttpEndpoint"/>` In this code, set the host attribute to the wildcard character (\*), as shown in the following example: `<httpEndpoint host="*" httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443" id="defaultHttpEndpoint"/>`
