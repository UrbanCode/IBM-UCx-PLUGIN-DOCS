# CICS CM (Beta) - Overview

IBM CICS Configuration Manager is a tool for managing and maintaining CICS Transaction Server definitions. It provides audit, reporting and lifecycle change management control facilities to support the build, management, and deployment of complex mainframe CICS applications.

You can use the CICS CM Beta plug-in for DevOps Deploy to automate your resource management process. The resource management process can be simplified by modelling the processes, that might be complex, across each of your environments. For example, these environments might be development, test, and production in different data centers.
