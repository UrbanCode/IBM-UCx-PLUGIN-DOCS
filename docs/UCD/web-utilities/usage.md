# Web Utilities - Usage

Use the **Send HTTP Call** step to specify an HTTP request and send the request to a web server. You can invoke a RESTful service against a specified URL and write the results to a file. You can use RESTful service calls to integrate with any technology that has a REST-based API.

The step response is available in the **responseBody** property. A payload with an HTTP response is not always returned. Sometimes only an HTTP status code is expected.

Use the **Upload to FTP Server** step to specify a file on the agents local file system to upload to an FTP server specified by the Hostname. The file will be uploaded to the directory on the FTP server specified by the File Path. You can optionally rename the file by specifying the Rename File. Note the extension must be explicitly stated in the Rename File property (i.e. newFileName.zip instead of just newFileName).
