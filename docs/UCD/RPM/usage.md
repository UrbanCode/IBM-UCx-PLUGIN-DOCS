# RPM - Usage

Use the RPM plug-in to automate installing, uninstalling, and updating packages in a deployment process. Packages are in the RPM file format. Typically, a package contains an application and all the required files that are associated with that application.

You can include RPM command options on the steps. See the [RPM Guide](http://rpm5.org/docs/rpm-guide.html) for list and description of options that can be included on each command.


## **Step palette**

To access this plug-in in the palette, click **Installers** > **RPM**.


## **Tips**

When you remove packages, if there is a dependency on another package an error message is issued.

An upgrade operation installs a new version of a package and removes all previous versions of the same package. If a package is not installed, the upgrade operation installs the package.
