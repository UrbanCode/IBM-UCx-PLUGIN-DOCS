# Jenkins Publisher - Usage


This plug-in is installed into the Jenkins server and provides the ability to publish artifacts into an IBM DevOps Deploy component as a post-build action.

For the Jenkins build step rather than the post-build action, refer to the [Jenkins Job Manager plug-in](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/jenkins-job-manager/).

The following pages provide usage information about Jenkins Publisher post-build integration:
