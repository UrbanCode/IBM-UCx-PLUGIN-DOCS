# IBM InfoSphere DataStage

IBM InfoSphere DataStage integrates data across multiple systems using a high performance parallel framework, and it supports extended metadata management and enterprise connectivity. The scalable platform provides more flexible integration of all types of data, including big data at rest (Hadoop-based) or in motion (stream-based), on distributed and mainframe platforms.

This InfoSphere DataStage plugin allows for the import and export of .isx and .dsx files.
