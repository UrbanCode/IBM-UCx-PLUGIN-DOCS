## Hybrid API DevOps

A DevOps platform for APIs provides the ability to streamline and automate the process of developing, building, testing and deploying APIs onto the API runtime cloud platform either when these APIs are organically developed or when they are exposed endpoints to existing backend services.

The GitHub repository [refarch-hybridcloud-blueportal-api](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-hybridcloud-blueportal-api) provides an in depth tutorial on implementing GitHub, Jenkins, DevOps Deploy, and API Connect into a single devops integration. This walkthrough was first introduced as a full lab session at IBM Interconnect 2017.
