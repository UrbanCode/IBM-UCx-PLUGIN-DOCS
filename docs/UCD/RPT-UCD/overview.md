# IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT) - Overview

**Overview** With the IBM Rational Test WorkbenchPerformance Tester plugin for DevOps Deploy, you can automate the execution of tests, compound tests, and schedules. To initiate a service test run, you must install either the SOA extension as part of Rational Performance Tester or install Rational Service Tester for SOA Quality on the target computer. For a performance test, install Rational Performance Tester on the target computer where the test will be run. When you run a schedule, ensure that the workbench is connected to the agent computers. If you run a schedule on the cloud, you must be aware of how much the run is going to cost you.

**Compatibility** This plug-in requires version 6.1 of IBM DevOps Deploy. This plug-in requires version 8.7 or later of Rational Performance Tester and Rational Performance Tester Agents.

**Installation** No special steps are required for the installation of the plugin. See Installing plug-ins in DevOps Deploy [documentation](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/wasdevops/blogs/laurel-dickson-bull1/2022/06/13/install-plugins).
