# IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers

The IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers plug-in includes steps to create database dependencies, build containers, run containers, and deploy artifacts to an IBM MobileFirst Server that is running in a container.

You can use IBM DevOps Deploy to define a DevOps deployment solution for your MobileFirst Platform Foundation artifacts. Using this type of solution, mobile teams can typically respond to feedback faster and have a repeatable process with reduced risk.
