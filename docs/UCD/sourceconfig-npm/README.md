NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. NPM includes command-line client that interacts with a remote registry. Using the command-line interface, you can use and distribute JavaScript modules that are available on the registry.

The Node Package Manager (NPM) source configuration plug-in uses the NPM command-line interface to import NPM packages as TAR files into component versions.
