Talos is a middleware configuration automation tool that integrates with a variety of cloud providers as well as IBM DevOps Deploy and is intended to automate configuration changes and application deployments across both commercial and open source middleware platforms and appliances eliminating the need to write custom scripts for each type of middleware.

* Import middleware configuration data in minutes from a runtime environment
* Rapid creation of deployment packages in a visual environment containing only relevant configuration data
* Supports creation of deployment packages that account for environmental differences (ability to deploy to Development, QA, Production environments etc.)
* Integration with 3rd party cloud providers
* Integration with IBM DevOps Deploy to automatically generate deployable components and resources for inclusion in Deployment workflow
* Create, clone, compare and mirror template based middleware environments for rapid environment build and change management
