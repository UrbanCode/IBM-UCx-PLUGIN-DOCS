# Nexus Source Config

Nexus is a repository manager, developed by SonaType, designed to store artifacts and cache remote repositories while providing universal package support.

This plug-in integrates with Nexus to retrieve artifacts hosted in a Maven repository using IBM DevOps Deployâ€™s import mechanism.

## Compatibility

The Nexus source configuration plug-in works with IBM DevOps Deploy 6.0.1+ and Nexus versions 2.x. Please use the [Maven Source Config plug-in](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/MavenSourceConfig/) for Nexus versions 3+.

If you have configured Nexus as a Docker container registry, you may use the [Docker Registry Source Config plug-in](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/DockerSourceConfig/) to manage containers.
