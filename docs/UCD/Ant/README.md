# Apache Ant


Apache Ant is a command line tool that is used to automate the build and deployment of applications. This plug-in calls the Ant executable to run one or more targets defined in a specified Ant script file, and is very useful for quickly integrating legacy automation into your DevOps Deploy Processes. IBM DevOps Deploy agents include a distribution of Ant, which is used by default, but other versions can be used by providing the path to the Ant installation directory in your Process Step.

**Platform Support:**

* This plug-in is supported to run on all operating systems supported by the DevOps Deploy agent, except for z/OS
* This plug-in is supported to run against Apache Ant v1.6.5 or higher
