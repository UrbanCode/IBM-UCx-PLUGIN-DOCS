# Oracle WebLogic Application Deployment

The Oracle Weblogic Server is an application server for building and deploying enterprise JAVA application programs.

The Oracle WebLogic Application Deployment plug-in provides processes to deploy, redeploy, and undeploy applications on a WebLogic server. Steps are also provided to start and stop deployed applications. The plug-in includes a component template to assist in setting up deployment automation.

**This plugin has been deprecated**

We are currently looking into the prospect of open sourcing this particular plugin so that users who want to continue using it can maintain their own versions. However, the [DevOps Deploy WLDeploy Plugin](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/WLDeploy/) will be actively supported and we encourage users to transition over. Another option is [DevOps Deploy WebLogic-WLST Plugin](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/WebLogic-WLST/), which uses Oracleâ€™s [WebLogic Scripting Tool](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E29542_01/web.1111/e13715/toc.htm).


**Platform Support:**

* This plug-in is supported for use with WebLogic Server version 10.3 or later.


## Available Steps

**Deploy:**Deploy an application to the Weblogic server.

**Redeploy:**Deploy an application to the Weblogic server again.

**Start:**Start a deployed application on the Weblogic server.

**Stop:**Stop a deployed application on the Weblogic server.

**Undeploy:**Remove a deployed application from the Weblogic server.
