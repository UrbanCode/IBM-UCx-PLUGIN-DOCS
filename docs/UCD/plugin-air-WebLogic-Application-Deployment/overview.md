# Oracle WebLogic Application Deployment - Overview

The Oracle WebLogic Application Server plug-in automates the deployment and management of applications on the Oracle WebLogic Server.

The plug-in includes these steps:

* [Deploy](#deploy)
* [Redeploy](#redeploy)
* [Start](#start)
* [Stop](#stop)
* [Undeploy](#undeploy)

**Note:** Deployment of .jar files is not supported.

All of the steps include the **Admin URL** property and the **Classpath** property. The administrative URL might use the tc3 or tc3s protocol, as opposed to http or https. For example, `t3://server.example.com:7001`. The classpath property must point to a file, not to a link.

The plug-in also includes a component template as an aid in setting up deployment automation. When you create a component from the template, you provide the following information:

* The location of the artifacts to deploy
* The Oracle WebLogic server to use
