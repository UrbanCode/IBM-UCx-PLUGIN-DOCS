| Handle Incremental Versions | Boolean                          | (Valid only with Sync Mode enabled) When selected, incremental version handling is enabled. When not selected, the legacy behavior is enabled, which is to handle incremental versions as though they are full versions. Enabling incremental version handling has two effects. First, when deploying a full version, all versions back to the most recently deployed full version are considered when determining which files to update or remove; the legacy behavior will only consider the the single most recently deployed version. Second, deploying an incremental version will not remove files from all currently deployed versions and will restore missing files from those versions; the legacy behavior will remove files from the single most recent currently deployed version and ignore files from other currently deployed versions. For server versions before 7.1.1.0, there is a negative performance impact to enabling this feature due to API availablity. The impact is the greatest for versions 6.2.7.0 through 7.1.0. Until 7.1.1.0, is not recommended to enable this feature unless you use incremental versions. | No       |
