# IBM DevOps Deploy Versioned File Storage - Overview


The steps in this plug-in work with versioned components. For example, the [Download Artifacts](steps.md#download-artifacts) step retrieves the latest version of a component. Most component deployment processes use this step to download the component artifacts to the agent system.

**Note**: For AIX systems, file permissions defined at the operating system level are not supported by the DevOps Deploy Versioned File Storage plug-in. The plug-in uses the permissions set by a process or script. The **chmod** command can be used to reset a permission to the value defined at the operating system level.

To add the IBM DevOps Deploy Versioned File Storage plug-in steps to processes, click **Repositories > Artifact > IBM DevOps Deploy** in the step palette of the process editor.

## Compatibility

This plug-in requires version 6.1 or later of IBM DevOps Deploy.

This plug-in is supported to run on all operating systems that are supported by the IBM DevOps Deploy agent.
