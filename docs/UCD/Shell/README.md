# Shell

A shell is software that provides an interface for users of an operating system that provides access to the services of a kernel.Operating system shells typically fall into 1 of 2 categories: command line and graphical. Command-line shells provide a command-line interface (CLI) to the operating system, while graphical shells provide a graphical user interface (GUI). In either category, the primary purpose of the shell is to call or start another program. Shells frequently have more capabilities such as viewing the contents of directories.

With the Shell plug-in, you can run custom shell scripts during the deployment process.
