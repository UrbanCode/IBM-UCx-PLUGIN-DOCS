# IBM WebSphere Portal - Overview

The WebSphere Portal plug-in includes steps to complete the following tasks on WebSphere Portal cells: deploy artifacts (such as themes, skins, and PAA files), run ConfigEngine commands, and run XML Access scripts.

The plug-in provides steps that you can use to automate deployment of artifacts and automate running commands.

* Deploy Theme
* Install PAA (Portable Application Archives)
* Deploy Portal WAR (web application archive)
* Execute ConfigEngine command
* Invoke XMLAccess script

The following steps provide an overview of the process you follow.

1. Create resources. If you use topology discovery, one resource with the PortalServer resource role is created. Manually populate resources by creating components under the PortalServer resource to represent deployable artifacts (themes, PAA files, WAR files, ConfigEngine commands, XMLAccess scripts).
2. Define properties for the resources.
3. Define components, applications, and environments to automate deployment.
4. Deploy.

## Compatibility

The plug-in works with WebSphere Portal versions 6.1, 6.1.5, 7.0, 8.0, 8.5 and 9.0. Both ND and stand-alone topologies are supported.

## Installation

This plug-in requires the [WebSphere Application ServerDeployment plug-in](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/Websphere/93-2/).

No special steps are required for installation. See [Installing plug-ins in DevOps products](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/wasdevops/blogs/laurel-dickson-bull1/2022/06/13/install-plugins "Installing plug-ins in DevOps products").
