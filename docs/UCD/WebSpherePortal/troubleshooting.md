# IBM WebSphere Portal - Troubleshooting

The WebSphere Portal plug-in stores the XML access script in the following file: `*agent\_home\_directory*/var/work/*component\_name*/xmlAccessScript.xml`. The output of the XML access command is written to the `xmlAccessScript_out.xml` file.

You can use these files to assist in troubleshooting when you are working with your Portal administrator or with IBM Support.
