# IBM Business Process Manager (WebSphere BPM)

IBM Business Process Manager is a comprehensive business process management platform, providing full visibility and insight to managing business processes. It provides tooling and a runtime environment for process design, execution, monitoring and optimization, along with basic system integration support. The product can be configured to support various levels of complexity and involvement with business process management.


The IBM WebSphere BPM source configuration plug-in for IBM DevOps Deploy imports Process Application snapshots as component versions. This plug-in is helpful if you do not have a build or continuous integration tool to assist with artifact migration from WebSphere BPM to IBM DevOps Deploy.
