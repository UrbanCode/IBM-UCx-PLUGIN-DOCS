# IBM WebSphere Commerce - Overview

The WebSphere Commerce plug-in includes steps to install, configure, and deploy a server deployment package to a WebSphere Commerce server on a WebSphere Commerce cell.

To add the WebSphere Commerce plug-in steps to processes, click **Application Server > Java > Commerce > WebSphere Commerce** in the step palette of the process editor.

A typical deployment includes the following procedures:

* Create resources. To deploy a server deployment package to a WebSphere Commerce server, you must populate resources manually. You can view the resources that you create in the Resources view. Each resource corresponds to the WebSphere Commerce server.
* Define components, applications, and environments to automate deployment.
* Deploy.
