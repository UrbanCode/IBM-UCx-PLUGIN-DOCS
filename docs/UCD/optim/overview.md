IBM InfoSphere Optim Test Data Management optimizes and automates the test data management process. This plug-in includes steps that run test data management commands in IBM InfoSphere Optim.

To add the IBM InfoSphere Optim plug-in steps to processes, click **Data Management > Optim** in the step palette of the process editor.
