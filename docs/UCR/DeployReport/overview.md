=============================

# Overview


### Overview




### Overview

The Deployment Reports plug-in provides an example of generating email-based
reports by using the UrbanCode Release plug-in framework and the Java REST API client that was introduced in UrbanCode
Release 6.1.1. Two example report formats are included. The reports are generated by using data extracted from UrbanCode
Release via the REST API, and rendered into HTML by using the Apache Velocity template engine. The reports are
delivered by using the same email notification configuration that is used by UrbanCode Release. To demonstrate the
capabilities of the plug-in, two additional functions are provided to generate a sample data set and to remove the
generated data.

### Installation

No special steps are required for installing the plug-in.
