Deployment Reports
==================

The IBM UrbanCode Release Deployment Reports plugin provides an example of using the UCR plugin framework and Java REST
API client introduced in UCR 6.1.1.0 to generate email based reports. Two example report formats are included, which are
rendered using data extracted from UCR via the REST API and rendered into HTML content via the Apache Velocity template
engine. The reports are delivered using the same email notification configuration used by the main UCR product into
which the plugin is deployed.

To assist with demonstrating the pluginâ€™s capabilities, two additional functions are
provided to generate a sample data set and to remove the generated data.
