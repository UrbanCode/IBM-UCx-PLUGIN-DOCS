Jira for IBM UrbanCode Release
==============================

Jira is an issue tracking tool. You can use the tool to capture and organize issues, assign work, and track activities.
Issues can be anything from development tasks, code errors, project tasks, help-desk tickets, or human resource request
forms. The JIRA product is developed by Atlassian.

The Jira plug-in provides integration with Jira. You can map Jira
projects to IBM UrbanCode Release applications. All issues in a mapped project are represented by change items in IBM
UrbanCode Release. The integration is not bi-directional; you cannot export from IBM UrbanCode Release to Jira.


**Platform Support:**

* This plug-in is supported for use with JIRA version 5 and later.
* The built-in Jira
integration for the IBM Urban Code Release server is deprecated. Install this plugin for Jira integration.
