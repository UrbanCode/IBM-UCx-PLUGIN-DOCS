IBM UrbanCode Deploy
====================

The IBM UrbanCode Deploy plug-in provides a full integration between IBM UrbanCode Release and IBM UrbanCode Deploy. It
replaces the built-in integration for versions 6.1.1.5 and later of IBM UrbanCode Release. The plug-in also improves
performance for the first full synchronization and for delta updates on subsequent synchronizations.

A full
synchronization is needed at first to import all objects from IBM UrbanCode Deploy. All synchronization after that
imports objects that change and typically does not take more than a few seconds.

The plug-in imports applications,
components, component versions, snapshots, environments, deployment processes from IBM UrbanCode Deploy for release
management purposes and allow the execution of UrbanCode Deploy deployment processes from IBM UrbanCode Release
scheduled deployments.

IBM Urbancode Deploy plugin version 9 or earlier requires IBM Urbancode Release version 6.1.1.5 to 7.0.0.3

IBM Urbancode Deploy plugin version 10 or later requires IBM Urbancode Release version 7.0.0.4 or later.
